Description

Initially created by Canonical, with the aim to offer a revolutionary
convergence experience combining the best of the mobile user experience and a
proper GNU/Linux and Free Software, being capable to provide differentiated but
consistent and friendly experiences to the same users, using the same device and
the same exact software with the same source code, but then taken over by the
UBports Community, Ubuntu Touch is the main hope for real GNU/Linux and privacy
on the mobile arena, and I will let you know why and how.

Extra Information
-----------------
I'll be presenting the UBports project work on Ubuntu Touch, the importance of this OS
for user freedom and privacy, and how can people like the typical PixelsCamp audinece
join in and help Ubuntu Touch, the mobile Free Software app ecossystem and even the
broader mobile GNU/Linux operating systems through the joint efforts between those and
the UBports Community.
